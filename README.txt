Sample ASP.NET Application
Scenario: Web Based Interactive Data Collection
Assume you have a client that needs to gather information from their user. The user will get onto a website and enter data about their Widget.  Below is the data we want to capture:
-	Widget name
-	Widget creation date and time
-	Widget type (Options are: A, B, 1, 2)
-	Widget sub-type (See options below. These should be dynamically loaded from the server when you select the type above)
o	A => Apple, Aardvark, Astronaut
o	B => Bear, Bobcat, Beaver
o	1 => First, One, Primary, Uno
o	2 => Second, Two, Secondary, Dos
This data should be submitted to the server and stored to a DB. Once the data is stored then display a page confirming the information that was stored.
When you finish reading this we can have one call to discuss any questions you may have.
Finally, please do not spend more than 2 hours on this app!
After 2 hours please submit the work you have and we will discuss your plan for the remaining items.
